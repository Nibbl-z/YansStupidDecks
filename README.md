# Decks

### Void Deck

A meaner and eviler counterpart of the Black Deck, with -**2 hands per round** and +2 joker slots. Good luck beating this on gold stake.

### Populated Deck

The opposite of the Abandoned Deck: It's all face cards. This makes it easy to get hands such as five of a kind, or use face card related jokers such as Triboulet or Smiley Face... while also making many others that affect numbered cards completely redundant.

### SUPER ULTRA HYPER DECK!!!

**THIS DECK BARELY WORKS AND I WILL PROBABLY FIX IT LATER BUT IT MULTIPLIES A BUNCH OF THINGS BY A SCALE OF 10.... 40 HANDS.. 30 DISCARDS... 10X BLIND REQUIREMENTS... 10X BLIND SCALING... 10X BASE CARD CHIP VALUES... 50 JOKER SLOTS... 80 HAND SIZE... 20 CONSUMABLE SLOTS... 20 SHOP SLOTS... 10X BASE CHIPS + MULT FOR EACH HAND AND 10X FASTER LEVELING...**

### AND YOU NEED TO BEAT ANTE 80 TO WIN!!! I DON'T THINK THAT IS POSSIBLE BUT GOOD LUCK!!!

Does Checkered Deck make it too easy to get flushes? Do you wish it was easier? Give the Solid Red Deck a try!!!
